These are scripts to do spatial averaging to a velocity field.


1. execute perlGlue.pl

   It will return a file called test.py.

2. add the code of ''extractVelocity.py'' into the test.py as a "head"

   It will create a final script to extract the velocity field.

3.  upload test.py to a server

   For example:

      $ pvpython test.py

## function explanation

1. extractVelocity.py file

   Specify the location of your case file that includes .foam

2. perlGlue.pl
